# Freestyle Project

Setup instructions!

This application is going to put people in position to accomplish two things: have a lot of fun and make a lot of money.

Our program will let users predict the over/under between any two basketball teams in NCAA DI. We are using data courtesy of Ken Pomeroy, a published statistician, to project the amount of total points scored for any two given teams. While in-season, our model will update daily with KenPom, assuring our users have the most accurate and up-to-date information that reflects each team's current capabilities.

# Our theory: Quantifying Moving People

While millions of people "bet" on sports everyday, we propose that the statistical significance in our theory and model makes our users not bettors but "strategic investors." Unlike two teams, which are competing against each other, our model is grounded in the theory that instead of having one offense constantly competing against another team's defense, each team's offense is perpetually competing *with* another team's offense to score as many points as possible. 

We use Adjusted Offense, which standardizes how many points a team will score on every possession, in conjunction with tempo, which dictates how many possessions a team has each game because of how fast or slow they play. Using these two all-encompassing yet standardized figures, we can determine how many points two teams will score together. 


# How it works: pick your teams

Our model is quite simple: pick any two schools. The user will be asked to select any 2 of the 353 teams in NCAA DI basketball, and our model will run through selected stats courtesy of Ken Pomeroy to find a points projection.

# Programming Requirements
1. Clone or download this repository onto your local computer

2. Install all required packages:
  Pip install -r requirements.t 
      (install beautifulsoup4, install requests, install statistics)
3. Navigate to local directory, and run script
  Python Freestyle_Final.py


# Disclaimer: Bearing potential costs

Just like any advisory shop, this projection is supposed to be used as guidance, *not* a verified calculation that will guarantee monetary rewards. Our model is not liable for any associated losses. 

Invest wisely!
